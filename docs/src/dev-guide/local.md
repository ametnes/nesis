# Local Development Guide

This guide walks you through how to start developing Nesis on your local workstation. You can
get an overview of the components that make up Nesis and its architecture [here](./architecture.md).

## Prerequisites
1. We use docker and docker-compose to support our development process. If you don't have docker installed
   locally, please for the [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/){target="_blank"} link for instructions on how
   install docker on your local workstation.
2. If you rather not install docker, you will need to have access to a Postgres and Memcached instance.
3. _Optional:_ The RAG Engine needs access to an LLM endpoint such as an OpenAI's endpoint or a private LLM endpoint 
in order to start querying your documents. You will need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and the `OPENAI_API_BASE`environment variables.
4. Recently, Huggingface requires a `HF_TOKEN` to download embedding models. You may need to obtain and set your `HF_TOKEN`.
5. You need to have python 3.11 for the API and RAG Engine microservices.
6. You also need to have node and npm installed.


!!! note "A word on vector databases"

    Nesis' RAG Engine requires a vector database to store vector embeddings. In order to contain the number of
    components, we use pgvector packaged into an extended Bitnami Postgres docker image `ametnes/postgresql:16-debian-12` 
    [here](https://github.com/ametnes/postgresql){target="_blank"}. You are however free to use other vector databases.
    Curently, we support `chromadb` and `qdrant`.


## Quick Start

Start by checking out the repository.

```bash
git checkout https://github.com/ametnes/nesis.git
cd nesis
```

### Using Docker

#### Build all the docker images locally.

```bash
{
    docker build --build-arg PUBLIC_URL=/ --build-arg PROFILE=PROD -t ametnes/nesis:latest-frontend . -f nesis/frontend/Dockerfile
    docker build -t ametnes/nesis:latest-api . -f nesis/api/Dockerfile
    docker build -t ametnes/nesis:latest-rag . -f nesis/rag/Dockerfile
}
```

#### Use the docker compose file to run the services locally. In your terminal, run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

#### Access the frontend locally.

1. Point your browser to [http://localhost:58000/](http://localhost:58000/)
2. Login with

      1. Email: `some.email@domain.com`
      2. Password: `password`

### Using your IDE

#### Start supporting services

Supporting services include

1. Postgres (for the backend database as well as the vector database).
2. Memcached for caching and locking services.
3. _Optional_ Minio for document storage.
4. _Optional_ Samba for document storage.

To start the supporting service, in a separate terminal, run
```bash
 docker-compose -f compose-dev.yml up
```

Set up your python virtualenv
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you do not have `source`, you can activate the virtualenv with
```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Start the RAG Engine
Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r nesis/rag/requirements.txt -r nesis/rag/requirements-torch-cpu-x86.txt -r nesis/rag/requirements-huggingface.txt --default-timeout=1200
```

Start the service
```bash
export NESIS_RAG_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS=384 
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
python nesis/rag/core/main.py
```

!!! warning "Huggingface vs OpenAI's Embeddings"

    Huggingface embeddings use a dimension of 384 while OpenAI's default embeddings size varies.
    The env variable `NESIS_RAG_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` can be used to alter the dimention of embeddings
    to suit your needs.

#### Start API Service
Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r nesis/api/requirements.txt
```

Running the database migration
```bash
alembic -x "url=postgresql://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:65432/nesis" --config nesis/api/alembic.ini upgrade head
```

Start the service
```bash
export NESIS_ADMIN_EMAIL="some.email@domain.com"
export NESIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD="password"
python nesis/rag/api/main.py
```

#### Start the frontend
Install dependencies
```bash
cd nesis/frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps --prefix client
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Start the frontend-backend service with
```bash
npm run start:server:local
```

In a separate terminal, start the frontend with
```bash
cd nesis/frontend
npm run start:client
```

#### Access the frontend locally.

1. Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
2. Login with

      1. Email: `some.email@domain.com`
      2. Password: `password`


## All done
You should now be ready to start developing Nesis
